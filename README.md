# Fine-Tuning-Llama2

### This notebook demonstrates the fine tuning of Llama-2 model.
Here I am using Llama-2 pretrained model and financial-phrase dataset to fine tune the model to custom dataset.
The pretrained model without fine tuning is having much less accuracy and other metrics but after fine tuning it for 1 epoch, it gives good results in terms of accuracy and other metrics.
